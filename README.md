# Monty Hall: Empirical proof to switch doors

The Monty Hall problem is often used to illustrate the less intuitive concepts in Probability theory.
However, it is very hard to explain, even to Math-inclined people. I remember that I never understood
the correct solution until I attempted a simulation back in 2010.
After discussing the problem with a colleague, I decided to write a simulation again. Below is the product
of my labour.

Pull Requests and Github Issues welcome! Any other feedback as well ;)
